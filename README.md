# HeartRateBroadcaster
Minimal app for connecting to a BLE heart rate monitor and broadcasting raw measurement data over websocket


## Getting started

- Wear your heart rate monitor and make sure it is turned on
- Go into Windows settings "Bluetooth & other devices" section
- Click "Add Bluetooth or other device" and pair your heart rate monitor with your computer
- Run the HeartRateBroadcaster application
- Right click the application tray icon to check connection status. It should show the name of your device if connection was successful. If it doesn't connect after a while, exit the application, try removing/unpairing all heart rate monitors in Windows settings and re-add only the device that you're using and try running the application again.
